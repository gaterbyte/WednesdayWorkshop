= Recover Grandpa's PC

== My Wednesday Workshop Project this week is recovering my Grandmothers PC.

* Her Windows install got messed up, and is super slow.
* When Moving her over to a SSD a few months ago the WD Blue 500 GB Drive up and died.
* Brand new, just died, after only being turned on maybe 10 times.
* So I went and bought a new one, they only had 1 TB at my Local Walmart.
* They also had a vseven USB3.0  dual bay docking station that we will give a try.
