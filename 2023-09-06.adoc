* Veilid is an open-source, peer-to-peer, mobile-Ô¨Årst, networked application framework.
* The framework is conceptually similar to IPFS and Tor, but faster and designed from the ground-up to provide all services over a privately routed network.
* The framework enables development of fully-distributed applications without a 'blockchain' or a 'transactional layer' at their base.
* The framework can be included as part of user-facing applications or run as a 'headless node' for power users who wish to help build the network.
